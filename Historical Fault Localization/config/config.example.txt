# HOW TO USE THE CONFIG FILE
# Configuration options can appear in any order.
# Use "#" for comments. (Any line that does not start with a recognized
# parameter name will be ignored. Using "#" makes comments easily identifiable
# and guarantees that they will never accidentally match a config option.)
#
# The format for a configuraion option is:
# parameterName value
#
# The only optional parameter is testHarnessOutput.

# The command line arguments appended to `git log --format=%H-%cd` in order to
# generate the list of commits that will be processed for the target program.
gitArguments --reverse --date-order faults ^master

# The path to the script that will be called in order to execute the target
# program's tests and collect coverage data on them.
testHarnessPath ../historical-fault-localization-target-ruby-app/test_harness/code_coverage.rb

# The path to the root of the target program's git repository. This path will
# also be passed to the test harness script as an argument, letting it know
# where to look for the program to test.
targetProgramDirectory ../historical-fault-localization-target-ruby-app

# The amount of time, in milliseconds, to allow the test harness to run before
# timing it out and proceeding to the next commit to test. Must be a long.

# Set to "ochiai" to use the Ochiai suspiciosness calculation algorithm. Set to
# "proximity" to use the proximity-based weighting algorithm.
suspiciousnessAlgorithm proximity

# Set to:
# "none" to indicate that the lower bound should be ignored.
# "quartile" to indicate that the lower bound should be the third quartile.
# "tail" to indicate that the lower quartile should be the lower outliers.
# This parameter is only required if suspiciousnessAlgorithm is set to
# "proximity".
lowerBound none

# Set to:
# "none" to indicate that the upper bound should be ignored.
# "quartile" to indicate that the upper bound should be the first quartile.
# "tail" to indicate that the upper quartile should be the upper outliers.
# This parameter is only required if suspiciousnessAlgorithm is set to
# "proximity".

# How many pixels tall each bar of color representing a statement in the final
# visualization should be. Must be an integer.

# How many pixels wide each bar of color representing a statement in the final
# visualization should be. Must be an integer.
statementWidth 200

# How many pixles there should be between stacks representing different files in
# the visualization. (The stacks are placed in a horizontal row.) Must be an
# integer.
fileMargin 50

# The font size to use for the labels indicating which horizontal stack
# corresponds to which file. Must be an integer.
fileFontSize 24

# The directory to save the visualization images to. This string must end with a

# OPTIONAL
# The location of the file that the test harness script should save its output
